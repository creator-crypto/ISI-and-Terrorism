    <h2>Understanding Terrorism</h2>
    <p>
      Terrorism refers to the use of violence or threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
      It has plagued societies across the globe for decades, manifesting in various forms including suicide bombings,
      cyberattacks, and mass shootings.
    </p>

    <p>
      The roots of terrorism can be ideological, religious, or political. Extremist groups often exploit vulnerable populations,
      using propaganda and fear to gain followers and instill terror among civilians.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rise of Global Terror Networks</h2>
    <p>
      In recent decades, global terror networks such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and others have posed significant threats to international security.
      These groups have developed complex financing, recruitment, and operational strategies that span across continents.
    </p>

    <p>
      The impact of terrorism is not only physical but also psychological and economic. Nations have increased surveillance,
      tightened border controls, and restructured intelligence cooperation to combat these threats.
    </p>

    <h2>What is ISI?</h2>
    <p>
      The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is the premier intelligence agency of Pakistan, founded in 1948. It is responsible
      for collecting and analyzing information related to national security and foreign affairs. The agency plays a critical role
      in defense and intelligence operations.
    </p>

    <p>
      ISI has been praised for its strategic capabilities but has also faced international scrutiny over alleged links to
      various militant organizations operating in and around the region.
    </p>

    <h2>Controversies and Allegations</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, multiple international agencies and analysts have accused ISI of having connections with certain extremist groups.
      These claims remain controversial and have led to strained diplomatic relations at times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pakistan, however, has repeatedly denied these allegations, stating that ISI is committed to national security and regional stability.
    </p>

    <h2>ISI’s Role in Regional Security</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the controversies, ISI has played a significant role in intelligence gathering during times of conflict, particularly
      in counterterrorism operations and border security.
    </p>

    <p>
      The agency’s involvement in regional politics, especially concerning Afghanistan and India, has had both stabilizing and destabilizing effects,
      depending on the context and perspective.
    </p>

    <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
    <p>
      Combating terrorism requires global cooperation and intelligence sharing. Agencies like ISI, along with others such as the CIA,
      MI6, and RAW, must focus on transparency, accountability, and shared goals to ensure peace and security.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is vital to distinguish between national defense efforts and actions that may inadvertently empower militant ideologies.
